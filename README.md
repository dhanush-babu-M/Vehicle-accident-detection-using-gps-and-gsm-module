📌 Project Overview

This project is an IoT-based accident detection system that automatically detects vehicle accidents and alerts emergency contacts in real-time.

Accelerometer sensor detects sudden impact or tilt.

GPS module captures the vehicle’s location.

GSM module sends an instant SMS alert with live coordinates to emergency contacts or hospitals.

Controller: Arduino Uno – low-cost, reliable, and scalable solution.

This system aims to reduce emergency response time and potentially save lives.

🚀 Problem Statement

Accidents often have delayed medical response due to:

Nearby people not reacting quickly

Victims being unable to call for help

Solution: Automated real-time alerts sent within seconds to emergency contacts.

🛠 Technologies & Components
Component	Purpose
Accelerometer (LxD35)	Detects tilt or impact
GPS Module	Captures vehicle location
GSM Module	Sends instant SMS alerts
Arduino Uno	Acts as main controller and integrates modules

Why chosen:

👥 Team & Roles

This project was developed by a team of four members:

Member 1: Hardware connections of accelerometer, GPS, and GSM modules

You (Member 2): Power supply design and stability, programming Arduino Uno, integrating modules, debugging, and testing

Member 3: Testing different accident scenarios, data collection

Member 4: Documentation and project demonstration

🏗 Challenges & Solutions

False positives: Calibrated accelerometer thresholds to avoid unnecessary alerts (e.g., speed breakers).

Instant SMS: Ensured stable power supply and correct AT command programming for GSM module.

📈 Future Improvements

Integrate IoT cloud services for online alert tracking

Develop a mobile app for real-time monitoring

Implement AI-based algorithms for better accident detection accuracy

💻 Relevance to IT/Software

Even though this is an embedded project:

Programming in C/C++ enhances problem-solving, debugging, and logical thinking

Skills are transferable to software development, especially in IoT, Full Stack, and real-time applications 🌟 Keywords (for HR & Recruiters)
