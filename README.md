![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-complete-green) ![Technology](https://img.shields.io/badge/tech-Arduino%20(C++)-blue)

## üìå Project Overview

This project is an IoT-based system that automatically detects vehicle accidents and alerts emergency contacts in real-time. It aims to reduce emergency response time and potentially save lives.

- **Accelerometer sensor** detects sudden impact or tilt.
- **GPS module** captures the vehicle‚Äôs location.
- **GSM module** sends an instant SMS alert with live coordinates to emergency contacts or hospitals.
- **Controller:** Arduino Uno ‚Äì a low-cost, reliable, and scalable solution.

## üöÄ Problem Statement

Accidents often have a delayed medical response because:
- Nearby people may not react quickly.
- Victims are often unable to call for help themselves.

**Solution:** This project provides automated, real-time alerts that are sent within seconds to emergency contacts, ensuring help is dispatched immediately.

## üë• My Role & Contributions

This project was developed by a team of four. My primary responsibilities were:

- **Power Supply Design:** Ensuring a stable and reliable power supply for all components.
- **Programming & Integration:** Writing the core logic in C/C++ for the Arduino Uno and integrating the accelerometer, GPS, and GSM modules.
- **Debugging & Testing:** Leading the debugging process and testing the system under various conditions to ensure reliability.

## üèóÔ∏è Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge: False Positives**
  - **Solution:** I calibrated the accelerometer's sensitivity thresholds to distinguish between actual accidents and minor events like hitting a speed breaker.

- **Challenge: Instant SMS Delivery**
  - **Solution:** I ensured a stable power supply to the GSM module and optimized the AT command programming for rapid and reliable message transmission.
