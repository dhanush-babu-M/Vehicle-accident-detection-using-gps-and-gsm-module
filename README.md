IoT-Based Accident Detection System ðŸš—âš¡
Overview

This project is an IoT-based accident detection system designed to automatically detect vehicle accidents and alert emergency contacts in real-time. Using sensors and communication modules, it reduces medical response delays and can potentially save lives.

Features

Detects sudden vehicle impacts or tilts using an accelerometer sensor.

Captures vehicle location through a GPS module.

Sends instant SMS alerts to emergency contacts or hospitals using a GSM module.

Real-time, automated accident detection and alert system.

Cost-effective and scalable solution using Arduino Uno as the controller.

Problem Solved

Accident victims often face delayed medical assistance due to:

Bystanders not reacting quickly.

Victims being unable to call for help.

This system automates the emergency response, sending alerts within seconds to reduce response time and save lives.

Technologies & Components Used
Component	Purpose
Arduino Uno	Microcontroller for system control and processing
Accelerometer (LxD35)	Detects tilt or sudden impacts
GPS Module	Provides accurate location coordinates
GSM Module	Sends SMS alerts to emergency contacts

Why Arduino Uno: Low-cost, reliable, easy to program, ideal for IoT projects.

How It Works

The accelerometer detects a sudden impact or tilt.

When the threshold is exceeded, the GPS module captures the location coordinates.

The GSM module sends an SMS alert with the location to predefined contacts.

The system continuously monitors for accidents, ensuring timely notifications.

Challenges & Solutions

False positives: Calibrated accelerometer thresholds to avoid triggering alerts on speed breakers or minor bumps.

Instant SMS delivery: Ensured stable power supply and correct AT command programming for the GSM module.
